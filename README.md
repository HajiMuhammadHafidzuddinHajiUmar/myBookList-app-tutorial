[Incomplete] ## MyBookList Web app is a simple CRUD app - made following a video tutorial. ##

Purpose: To make a simple app using vanilla javascript by Object Oriented Programming

Includes: HTML, Bootstrap, JS.

Issues: Update feature submits all previously done updates again.

------------------------------------------------
- Step 1: Book, UI, UI.displayBooks, UI.addBookToList
- Step 2: Add a book event, UI.clearFields
- Step 3: Remove a book event, UI.deleteBook
- Step 4: Validation for adding a book
- Step 5: UI.showAlert for fail add book, success add book, and removing a book
- Step 6: Store.getBooks, Store.addBook, Store.removeBook - localStorage
